title: "quarto-pins"

The goal of this repo is to show how to publish a web-based pins board using Quarto.

```{r}
library("pins")
library("here")
```

To try to answer a question about Quarto, I am going to create two boards; normally, I would just create one.

```{r}
board_one <- board_folder(here("data/board_one"), versioned = FALSE)
board_two <- board_folder(here("data/board_two"), versioned = FALSE)
```

For each board, write a pin:

```{r}
board_one |> pin_write(mtcars, "mtcars", type = "json")
```

```{r}
board_two |> pin_write(mtcars, "mtcars", type = "json")
```

For each board, write a manifest:

```{r}
board_one |> write_board_manifest()
board_two |> write_board_manifest()
```
